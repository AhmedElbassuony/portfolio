          <h1>About me</h1>
          <h2>ðŸ’¡ I build software, share knowledge, and inspire others to create with technology.</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in Computer science and Artificial Intelligence
            and
            a passion for both developing applications and teaching programming. For over two years, I've
            been
            guiding students through programming fundamentals, algorithms, and real-world projectsâ€”while
            creating clear, engaging learning content that makes coding approachable for all skill levels.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside my teaching, I work on full-stack application development designing user interfaces,
            building backend systems, and managing databases to bring complete solutions to life. While my
            professional focus has been on education and content creation, my engineering background ensures
            I
            write clean, efficient, and scalable code
          </p>
          <p>
            For me, software engineering is more than just solving technical problems it's about creating,
            sharing, and inspiring. I'm always learning, experimenting, and finding better ways to make
            technology impactful and accessible.
